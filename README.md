# WhereInTheWorld
iOS Game

Spun up this simple game as a way to escape from covid. In this state of lockdown, without the ability to travel, thought it would be fun to have an app that
remind users of all of the amazing places in the world. I also thought it would be interesting to have a quantifiable metric of how closely people think a photo 
is from versus reality. 

The objective is to guess where in the world a picture is from, based off 4 options, and your score is the net distance from your guesses to the answers, 
a perfect score is therefore 0.
