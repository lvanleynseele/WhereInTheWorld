# WhereInTheWorld
iOS Game

Spun up this simple game as a way to escape from covid. In this state of lockdown, without the ability to travel, thought it would be fun to have an app that
reminds users of all of the amazing places in the world. I also thought it would be interesting to have a quantifiable metric of how closely people can guess where a photo is from. 

The objective is to guess where in the world a picture is from, based off 4 options, and your score is the net distance from your guesses to the answers, 
a perfect score is therefore 0.
